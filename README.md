## Personal dotfiles, .vim && dev setups 
## also contains bfn system scripts in python && bash
still experimental

would love to just rip off someone else's open source dotfiles or .vim but that's just won't make me feel comfortable #black_box

feel free to dig through you might find some thing that interest you......



## plugin use @ vim 



## pluging for bash && zsh
